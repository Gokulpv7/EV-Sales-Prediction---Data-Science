📊 Machine Learning Regression Model Comparison

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using Python. The goal is to build predictive models, evaluate their performance, and compare different algorithms to determine the best fit for the dataset. The notebook includes preprocessing, model training, testing, evaluation metrics, and visualization.

🚀 Features

🔍 Train/Test Split for unbiased evaluation

🤖 Linear Regression model as a baseline

🌲 Random Forest Regressor for improved accuracy

📈 Model evaluation using RMSE and R² score

🎨 Actual vs Predicted visualization for model performance

🧪 Reproducible experiment setup

🛠️ Technologies Used
Category	Tools
Programming Language	Python
Machine Learning	Scikit-Learn
Data Processing	NumPy, Pandas
Visualization	Matplotlib
Environment	Jupyter Notebook
📁 Files Included
File	Description
DS.ipynb / DS.html	Contains complete workflow from training to evaluation
📌 Evaluation Metrics

The project compares models using:

R² Score: Measures how well predictions match actual values

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): Measures prediction error magnitude

Sample output format:

Model	R² Score	RMSE
Linear Regression	X.XXX	XXXX
Random Forest	X.XXX	XXXX

(Random Forest generally performs better.)

📉 Visualization

A scatter plot is included to compare actual vs predicted values, helping assess model accuracy visually.
